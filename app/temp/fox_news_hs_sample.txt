1:MikeSte Merkel, possible the only person in charge who is worse than what we have. Obama is trying his hardest though to get to Merkel's level. "A 21-year-old Iraqi man was convicted of sexual assault and given a one-year suspended sentence. A 26-year-old Algerian man was convicted of abetting a sexual assault and attempted assault, and given the same sentence." Sounds exactly like how Obama is trying to let all of the black people in this country get away with everything.

1:AllaGranovskaya look like merkel just want to get laid
1:ElCampeador " but criticized two measures in the bill that could see people who aren't directly involved in the assault punished and foreigners deported for sexual harassment" Sounds like some German Legislators have the same mental disease the Democrats and Republicans who opposed Kate's Law had. Deporting people who are not citizens for acting like savages - how cruel!! (sarcasm)
